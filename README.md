# Assemb.ly Circuit Validation
This application uses machine vision to analyze production circuits and make sure that errors in production do not get forwarded to the end user. Components being implemented are put through a hand trained model to determine when production boards are missing essential components. This provides peace of mind for the customer along with providing a dataset of how the manufacturing company can make products.

This system was built using PyTorch for the ML backend with React and Node.js for the front-end. The backend database and connections were accomplished using Django.
